-- Calculer le ratio read/write pour les indexes indiqu�s comme 'missing' ********************************************************************************
-- Aaron Bertrand : http://www.sqlperformance.com/2013/06/t-sql-queries/missing-index
-- ratio write:read > 1, attention aux p�nalit�s de mise � jour
-- ratio write:read > 0, OK plus le ratio est bas, plus il est en faveur d'une cr�ation d'index.
